# API Documentation
Before you checkout The API Documentation, these are several libraries that we have used:

1. [*RestSharp*](http://restsharp.org/): REST Interface with Daraja
2. [*Bouncy Castkle*](http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/) Used for generation of SecurityCredential
3. [*Xunit*](https://xunit.github.io/): Unit Testing

Thats it!
